# yt_playlist_fetch.py
Very simple script to archive all of your youtube music playlists.  Relies on ytmusicapi. 

The hardest part is creating the required headers_auth.json file (documented under setup here - https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html). 

If playlists are public it may work without the json file.
